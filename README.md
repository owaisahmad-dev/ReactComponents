# React Components Practice

This repo contains the code for the small project I did to learn React. The purpose of the project was to understand the transfer and sharing of data between components. This project does not contain any API calls, all the data used in the project is hardcoded.

## Application

The application is a pretty simple one. It is a restaurant's landing page where you can see the menu items, and when you click on an item, you can see the details of the item. The details include description, price, enlarged image and reviews.

## Technologies Used

I have used React + Vite + TailwindCSS for the frontend, and used Docker for deployment. This project doesn't have any backend.
